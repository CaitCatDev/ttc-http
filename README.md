# ttc-http:
Orginally named lchttp and designed as a simple HTTP request library we have rebraned to ttc-http as part of our effort to be part of the TTC communitty on discord and be a part of the bot that runs the server. However the bot modules are designed in a friendly manner meaning we can still be used indepently wheter you have a bot developement project or just want to send requests in C we are still avaliable to used.

## What it works on:
We should work fine on any platform as we are using C stdlibrary and nothing else and where we give you the raw request string it should be able to intergrated in to C on any platform wheter that be Linux, MAC OSX, BSD, or Windows.

However I do not own all these systems so if there are bugs relating to a certain system please let me know

## How to use it:
To include this in to your project either just include it in your projects local source tree. Or to install it system wide install it in your systems shared library folder and includes search folder.

## Bug reporting:
If you find a bug please report it. Ideally the more info you can provide the better but if you can provide steps to reproduce that will help a lot.

## Other Issues:
if you have other issues or suggestions they are welcome in github issues page or pull requests are welcome. But where we aim to keep the library relatively simple they may not always be accpeted. But of course your more than welcome to fork this code and continue it however you feel best. :3
